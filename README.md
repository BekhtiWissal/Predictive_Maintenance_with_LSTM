This project's purpose was to predict the next values for health parameters of an electrical motor, in order to ensure predictive maintenance using the recurrent neural networks. 

You will provided with two documents: 
Data : an excel file containing all values for health and operational parameters of the motor depending on time. 
An ABB sensor had been placed on the motor and an ABB platform provides a visualization of the variations of these parameters. 

RNN-LSTM code: this is an ipynb file with the code written that permittes the perdiction of the next sequences of these parameteres. 
The algorithm is an LSTM neural network. And it was already run to get the same sequence that i used as an example of predictions in the report.
